This repository contains a simple SQL query demonstrating a common error related to the `>` operator. The query intends to select all employees in the 'Sales' department with salaries greater than 100000. However, it inadvertently excludes employees with salaries exactly equal to 100000.  The solution demonstrates how to modify the query to include these edge cases.  This is a common error in SQL queries that often leads to unexpected or incomplete results.
